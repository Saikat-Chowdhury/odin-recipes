        <h3>Keep calm and Eat shawarma --</h3>
        <p>Shawarma (/ʃəˈwɑːrmə/; Arabic: شاورما) is a popular Levantine dish consisting of meat cut into thin slices, stacked in a cone-like shape, and roasted on a slowly-turning vertical rotisserie or spit.</p>
        <p>Originally made with lamb or mutton, it is now also made of chicken.</p>

            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>500 grams Chicken</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive</li>
                <li>Spices </li>

            <h4>Steps needed for making the dish:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the shawarma spice mixture. Simply add the spices into a small bowl and mix to combine.</li>
                <li>Cut up some boneless, skinless chicken thighs into small bite-size pieces (you can use chicken breast if you like, this is just my personal preference.)</li>
                <li>When ready, lay the chicken shawarma on a large sheet pan and bake in 425 degrees heated oven for 30 minutes or so (you can check a bit earlier as ovens do vary.)</li>
                <li>The true Middle Eastern way to serve chicken shawarma is in pita pockets or wraps with heaps of veggies and a good deal of sauce.</li>
